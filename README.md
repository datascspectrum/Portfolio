 About Me
 Hey over there, I’m a data-driven person, passionate about learning new things all the time, I have around 6 years of experience working in the services industry field, handling suppliers and clients, my main development was through the quality department, mostly organizational quality improvement, while my job was not directly a hard use of data analysis because the amount of data was low, in these 6 years, I have always used data to follow key performance indicators, forecasting sales, data visualization of costs etc.
I have been preparing to change my career path for a more Data Analyst roll, that’s why if you check my resume, I have preparation in skills like Python, SQL, Tableu, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, R Studio, Selenium.
I consider that experiences in my life have developed the ability of being creative, strong emotional intelligence and leadership. I am looking to have a long-lasting labor relationship where I can grow my potential.
