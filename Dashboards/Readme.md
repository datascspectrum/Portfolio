## Dashboard of JMU SELLOS MEC√ÅNICOS SALES

Here you can check an interactive dashboard if you open the tableau file.

We have the option to filter the sales year between 2016-2022.

The amount of sales has a color bar for low sales in red and high sales in green.

We can see a data legend that represents the color for each year we have active.

One of the most important filters is the client's filter, with this one we would be able to see how this client performs in :\
---Historical behaviour\
---Monthly historical behaviour\
---Monthly for a specific year\
---When was the last time we sold to them\
---Which ones are our better clients\
---Which clients have we not paid enough attention to

Also if you see the tableau file, you will find a prediction worksheet and a frequency worksheet.
